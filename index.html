## What is SoulCue AI?

**SoulCue AI** is a chat-based relationship coach that helps you:

- unpack difficult conversations,
- understand why you keep repeating the same patterns,
- rehearse messages before sending them,
- build calmer, clearer, kinder communication habits.

Instead of doom-scrolling or overthinking alone, you can open SoulCue AI and talk it through.

## What you can do in the app

### 🧠 Chat with AI coaches

Different AI coaches focus on different themes, for example:

- conflict after arguments,
- boundaries and saying “no” without guilt,
- anxiety while waiting for a reply,
- self-sabotage and choosing unavailable partners.

Each coach has their own tone and style, but all of them are here to help you slow down, reflect, and respond more intentionally.

### 💬 Practice texting before you send

Not sure how to reply?

- paste the message you want to send,
- describe the situation,
- ask SoulCue AI to help you draft a calm, honest response.

You can see several options, adjust the wording, and choose what feels most like you.

---

### 🎯 Guided trainings & scenarios

SoulCue AI includes **training scenarios** that feel like realistic chats:

- “Texting after conflict”
- “Saying no without guilt”
- “Waiting for reply anxiety”
- “Breaking old patterns”

Each training walks you through a short, structured conversation:
you see example messages, choose your response, and get gentle feedback along the way.

---

### 🔍 Insights & patterns over time

As you use the app, SoulCue AI can highlight:

- recurring patterns in your stories and messages,
- triggers that lead to conflict or anxiety,
- moments where you successfully chose a healthier response.

The goal is not to judge you, but to help you notice:  
**“this is where I usually choose chaos – and this time I didn’t.”**

---

## Who SoulCue AI is for

SoulCue AI can be helpful if you:

- keep ending up in similar, painful relationship dynamics,
- replay conversations in your head and think “I should’ve said it differently”,
- struggle to set boundaries and feel guilty when you try,
- feel anxious when someone doesn’t text back,
- want to communicate more clearly and kindly – with others and with yourself.

You don’t need to be in a “perfect” relationship to start doing this work.
SoulCue AI is here for the messy, very human middle.
