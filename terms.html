<h1>Terms of Use — SoulCue AI</h1>
<p><small>Effective date: 29-11-25</small></p>

<p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the mobile application SoulCue AI ("App") and related services. The App is operated by <strong>Individual Entrepreneur Dmitrii Kotelnikov</strong>, located at <strong>Building 5, Ponichala 3 Settlement, Krtsanisi District, Tbilisi 0190, Georgia</strong>. Contact: <a href="mailto:insane.products.studio@gmail.com">insane.products.studio@gmail.com</a>. By using the App you agree to these Terms.</p>

<p>For users who download the App via the Apple App Store, your use of the App is also subject to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement ("Apple Standard EULA"). In case of any conflict between these Terms and the Apple Standard EULA, the Apple Standard EULA will govern your relationship with Apple, and these Terms will govern your relationship with us regarding the SoulCue AI service, subscriptions, and content.</p>

<h2>1. License and Eligibility</h2>
<p>Subject to the Apple Standard EULA (where applicable) and these Terms, we grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>
<p>The App is intended for individuals aged 16 and older. If you are under 16, you may not use the App. If you are between 16 and 18 (or the age of majority in your country), you should use the App only with permission from a parent or legal guardian where required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>2. No Account Registration</h2>
<p>The App can be used without creating a traditional user account or password. We may use an application-level identifier or similar technical identifier to operate the service, maintain functionality, personalize your experience, and prevent abuse on a specific device or browser.</p>
<p>If you delete the App, reset your device, or clear local storage, some or all of your data, settings, and personalization may be lost.</p>

<h2>3. Subscriptions and Billing (Auto-Renewal)</h2>
<p>The App may offer auto-renewing subscriptions that unlock additional features or content.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase.</li>
  <li>Your subscription automatically renews unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
  <li>Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
  <li>The current price and subscription length are shown on the purchase screen in the App and in your Apple ID subscription settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in <em>Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</em>. If a free trial is offered, it will convert to a paid subscription at the end of the trial unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends.</p>
<p>Subscription availability, pricing, and promotional offers may vary by region and according to Apple’s policies. Any refunds or billing disputes are handled solely according to Apple’s rules and processes. We do not provide additional refunds beyond what Apple allows.</p>

<h2>4. Not Medical, Therapeutic, or Crisis Care</h2>
<p>SoulCue AI is a self-help and coaching tool designed to support reflection, communication, and personal development. It is <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>medical care;</li>
  <li>psychological or psychiatric treatment;</li>
  <li>professional therapy or counseling;</li>
  <li>legal, financial, or other regulated professional advice;</li>
  <li>crisis or emergency support.</li>
</ul>
<p>The App does not create a doctor–patient, therapist–client, or similar professional relationship.</p>
<p>In emergencies or crisis situations (including risk of harm to yourself or others), do not rely on the App. Contact local emergency services or crisis hotlines immediately, or seek help from qualified professionals.</p>
<p>No specific outcomes, improvements, or results are guaranteed. Any positive changes in communication, relationships, or emotional well-being may vary by individual and depend on many factors outside our control.</p>

<ul>
  <li>operating and providing the App and related services;</li>
  <li>maintaining and improving the App and its AI models and features;</li>
  <li>ensuring security, preventing abuse, and complying with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI-generated outputs may be fictional, inaccurate, incomplete, or not suitable for your specific situation. Do not rely on AI responses for decisions involving medical, psychological, legal, financial, or safety matters. Always use your own judgment and, where appropriate, consult a qualified professional.</p>

<h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>

<p>Except where prohibited by applicable law, any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App will be resolved by the courts located in Georgia. Where the laws of your country require a different venue or provide you with mandatory consumer protections, those protections will continue to apply.</p>

<h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time, for example when we change or add features, update our business practices, or comply with new legal requirements.</p>
<p>We will post the updated Terms within the App and/or on our website and update the "Effective date" above. When feasible, we will also notify users in the App. Your continued use of the App after the updated Terms become effective means that you accept the changes.</p>
