<h1>Terms of Use — SoulCure AI</h1>

<p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the mobile application SoulCure AI (“App”). The App is operated by [COMPANY], located at [ADDRESS], contact: [EMAIL]. By using the App you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. License and Eligibility</h2>
<p>We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App. The App is intended for individuals aged 16+.</p>

<h2>2. No Account Registration</h2>
<p>The App can be used without creating an account. We may use an application-level identifier to operate the service and prevent abuse.</p>

<h2>3. Subscriptions and Billing (Auto-Renewal)</h2>
<p>The App may offer auto-renewing subscriptions. Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Renewal is charged within 24 hours prior to the end of the period. Manage or cancel your subscription in <em>Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</em>. If a free trial is offered, it converts to a paid subscription unless canceled at least 24 hours before the trial ends. Prices may change; if they do, we will notify you as required. Refunds are handled by Apple’s policies.</p>

<h2>4. Not Medical or Crisis Care</h2>
<p>SoulCure AI is a self-help and coaching tool. It is <strong>not</strong> a medical, psychological, legal, or crisis service and does not provide professional diagnosis or treatment. In emergencies, call local emergency numbers or crisis hotlines.</p>

<h2>5. AI and Your Content</h2>
<p>You are responsible for the content you submit. You retain ownership of your input; you grant us a limited license to process it for operating and improving the service. AI-generated outputs may be inaccurate or incomplete—use your own judgment.</p>

<h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to: (a) violate laws or third-party rights; (b) upload harmful or illegal content; (c) attempt to reverse engineer or disrupt the service; (d) use the App to train competing models without our permission; (e) spam or harass other users.</p>

<h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App integrates with third-party processors and platforms, including [LLM_PROVIDER] (AI processing), Google Firebase (analytics and diagnostics), Adapty (subscription management), and Apple (payments). Your use of those services may also be governed by their terms.</p>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or misuse the App. You may stop using the App at any time and can cancel subscriptions via Apple settings.</p>

<h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
<p>The App is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data.
