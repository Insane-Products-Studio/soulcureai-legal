<h1>Privacy Policy — SoulCure AI</h1>
<p><small>Effective date: [DATE]</small></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how [COMPANY] (“we”, “us”) processes information when you use the SoulCure AI mobile application (“App”). Controller: [COMPANY], [ADDRESS]. Contact: <a href="mailto:[EMAIL]">[EMAIL]</a>.</p>

<h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chat content:</strong> your messages and saved insights so the App can generate responses. Your inputs may be transmitted to [LLM_PROVIDER] via our backend for inference and safety checks.</li>
  <li><strong>Device & usage data:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, language, time zone, approximate region, IP (transient), timestamps, and in-app events.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics & diagnostics:</strong> events (Firebase Analytics) and crash logs (Crashlytics).</li>
  <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> subscription status and receipts via Apple and Adapty. We do not receive your full payment card details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
<p>To operate and improve the App, provide AI responses, ensure security and abuse prevention, deliver support, comply with law, and (if enabled) personalize your experience.</p>

<h2>3. Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
<p>Contract performance (providing the App), legitimate interests (security, improvement, analytics), and consent where required.</p>

<h2>4. Sharing and Processors</h2>
<p>We share personal data with processors strictly for the purposes above:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>[LLM_PROVIDER]</strong> — AI processing of your inputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> — analytics and crash diagnostics.</li>
  <li><strong>Adapty</strong> — subscription management.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple</strong> — payment processing and receipts.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share de-identified or aggregated statistics. We do not sell personal data.</p>

<h2>5. International Transfers</h2>
<p>Data may be processed in countries outside your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>

<h2>6. Storage & Retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chat history:</strong> stored on your device. If you enable cloud synchronization (when available), a copy may be stored on our servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics & logs:</strong> typically retained up to 24 months, then deleted or anonymized.</li>
  <li>We may retain minimal records to meet legal obligations and prevent abuse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, or port your data, and to object to certain processing. To exercise rights, contact <a href="mailto:[EMAIL]">[EMAIL]</a>. You can opt out of analytics where the App provides a setting, or by contacting us.</p>

<h2>8. Children</h2>
<p>The App is intended for users aged 16+. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under this age.</p>

<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable safeguards (e.g., TLS in transit, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>10. California/US State Notices</h2>
<p>We do not sell personal information. California and certain US state residents may request access or deletion. Submit requests at <a href="mailto:[EMAIL]">[EMAIL]</a>. We will not discriminate for exercising privacy rights.</p>
